Infrastructure layer

The most characteristic part of this layer is the implementation of REPOSITORIES to perform persistence and data access.
This module is also where we implement everything related to the model and connections/actions to the ENTITY FRAMEWORK database.

At the level of each functional MODULE (in this case, MainModule) we will have of a single project with the following elements:
   - "DataModel": Will contain the EntityFramework model.
      Although the classes generated by the Entity Framework (Container and POCO/IPOCO Entities) we will extract to other projects to be able to decouple it according to the design of the Domain in DDD.
      Here will only be the data model (In our case, MainModuleDataModel.edmx).
   - "Context" implements an abstraction of the context/container of EntityFramework, to be able to replace it with a fake/mock and perform unitary tests.
   - Repositories: Classes in charge of the logic of persistence of data.

We will also have another project for the Tests of the entire module.

"Core" type projects are projects to be used to implement base classes and extensions that are valid for horizontal reuse in the implementation Persistence Layer of all functional modules of the application.
